  # - :on - The events to track (optional; defaults to all of them). Set
  #   to an array of `:create`, `:update`, `:destroy` and `:touch` as desired.
  # - :class_name (deprecated) - The name of a custom Version class that
  #   includes `PaperTrail::VersionConcern`.
  # - :ignore - An array of attributes for which a new `Version` will not be
  #   created if only they change. It can also accept a Hash as an
  #   argument where the key is the attribute to ignore (a `String` or
  #   `Symbol`), which will only be ignored if the value is a `Proc` which
  #   returns truthily.
  # - :if, :unless - Procs that allow to specify conditions when to save
  #   versions for an object.
  # - :only - Inverse of `ignore`. A new `Version` will be created only
  #   for these attributes if supplied it can also accept a Hash as an
  #   argument where the key is the attribute to track (a `String` or
  #   `Symbol`), which will only be counted if the value is a `Proc` which
  #   returns truthily.
  # - :skip - Fields to ignore completely.  As with `ignore`, updates to
  #   these fields will not create a new `Version`.  In addition, these
  #   fields will not be included in the serialized versions of the object
  #   whenever a new `Version` is created.
  # - :meta - A hash of extra data to store. You must add a column to the
  #   `versions` table for each key. Values are objects or procs (which
  #   are called with `self`, i.e. the model with the paper trail).  See
  #   `PaperTrail::Controller.info_for_paper_trail` for how to store data
  #   from the controller.
  # - :versions - Either,
  #   - A String (deprecated) - The name to use for the versions
  #     association.  Default is `:versions`.
  #   - A Hash - options passed to `has_many`, plus `name:` and `scope:`.
  # - :version - The name to use for the method which returns the version
  #   the instance was reified from. Default is `:version`.
  #
  # Plugins like the experimental `paper_trail-association_tracking` gem
  # may accept additional options.
  #
  # You can define a default set of options via the configurable
