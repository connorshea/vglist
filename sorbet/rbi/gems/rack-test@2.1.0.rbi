# to the current session: :request, :get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options,
# :head, :custom_request, :follow_redirect!, :header, :env, :set_cookie,
# :clear_cookies, :authorize, :basic_authorize, :last_response, and :last_request.

# which will automatically build a session when it's first used.

  #
  # Note: Generally, you won't need to initialize a Rack::Test::Session directly.
  # Instead, you should include Rack::Test::Methods into your testing context.
  # (See README.rdoc for an example)
  #
  # The following methods are defined via metaprogramming: get, post, put, patch,
  # delete, options, and head. Each method submits a request with the given request
  # method, with the given URI and optional parameters and rack environment.
  # Examples:
  #
  #   # URI only:
  #   get("/")                   # GET /
  #   get("/?foo=bar")           # GET /?foo=bar
  #
  #   # URI and parameters
  #   get("/foo", 'bar'=>'baz')  # GET /foo?bar=baz
  #   post("/foo", 'bar'=>'baz') # POST /foo (bar=baz in request body)
  #
  #   # URI, parameters, and rack environment
  #   get("/bar", {}, 'CONTENT_TYPE'=>'foo')
  #   get("/bar", {'foo'=>'baz'}, 'HTTP_ACCEPT'=>'*')

  # submitted in #last_request. The methods store a Rack::MockResponse based on the
