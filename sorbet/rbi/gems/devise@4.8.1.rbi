# The routing module provides URL rewriting in native Ruby. It's a way to
# redirect incoming requests to controllers and actions. This replaces
# mod_rewrite rules. Best of all, Rails' \Routing works with any web server.
# Routes are defined in <tt>config/routes.rb</tt>.
#
# Think of creating routes as drawing a map for your requests. The map tells
# them where to go based on some predefined pattern:
#
#   Rails.application.routes.draw do
#     Pattern 1 tells some request to go to one place
#     Pattern 2 tell them to go to another
#     ...
#   end
#
# The following symbols are special:
#
#   :controller maps to your controller name
#   :action     maps to an action with your controllers
#
# Other names simply map to a parameter as in the case of <tt>:id</tt>.
#
# == Resources
#
# Resource routing allows you to quickly declare all of the common routes
# for a given resourceful controller. Instead of declaring separate routes
# for your +index+, +show+, +new+, +edit+, +create+, +update+ and +destroy+
# actions, a resourceful route declares them in a single line of code:
#
#  resources :photos
#
# Sometimes, you have a resource that clients always look up without
# referencing an ID. A common example, /profile always shows the profile of
# the currently logged in user. In this case, you can use a singular resource
# to map /profile (rather than /profile/:id) to the show action.
#
#  resource :profile
#
# It's common to have resources that are logically children of other
# resources:
#
#   resources :magazines do
#     resources :ads
#   end
#
# You may wish to organize groups of controllers under a namespace. Most
# commonly, you might group a number of administrative controllers under
# an +admin+ namespace. You would place these controllers under the
# <tt>app/controllers/admin</tt> directory, and you can group them together
# in your router:
#
#   namespace "admin" do
#     resources :posts, :comments
#   end
#
# Alternatively, you can add prefixes to your path without using a separate
# directory by using +scope+. +scope+ takes additional options which
# apply to all enclosed routes.
#
#   scope path: "/cpanel", as: 'admin' do
#     resources :posts, :comments
#   end
#
# For more, see <tt>Routing::Mapper::Resources#resources</tt>,
# <tt>Routing::Mapper::Scoping#namespace</tt>, and
# <tt>Routing::Mapper::Scoping#scope</tt>.
#
# == Non-resourceful routes
#
# For routes that don't fit the <tt>resources</tt> mold, you can use the HTTP helper
# methods <tt>get</tt>, <tt>post</tt>, <tt>patch</tt>, <tt>put</tt> and <tt>delete</tt>.
#
#   get 'post/:id', to: 'posts#show'
#   post 'post/:id', to: 'posts#create_comment'
#
# Now, if you POST to <tt>/posts/:id</tt>, it will route to the <tt>create_comment</tt> action. A GET on the same
# URL will route to the <tt>show</tt> action.
#
# If your route needs to respond to more than one HTTP method (or all methods) then using the
# <tt>:via</tt> option on <tt>match</tt> is preferable.
#
#   match 'post/:id', to: 'posts#show', via: [:get, :post]
#
# == Named routes
#
# Routes can be named by passing an <tt>:as</tt> option,
# allowing for easy reference within your source as +name_of_route_url+
# for the full URL and +name_of_route_path+ for the URI path.
#
# Example:
#
#   # In config/routes.rb
#   get '/login', to: 'accounts#login', as: 'login'
#
#   # With render, redirect_to, tests, etc.
#   redirect_to login_url
#
# Arguments can be passed as well.
#
#   redirect_to show_item_path(id: 25)
#
# Use <tt>root</tt> as a shorthand to name a route for the root path "/".
#
#   # In config/routes.rb
#   root to: 'blogs#index'
#
#   # would recognize http://www.example.com/ as
#   params = { controller: 'blogs', action: 'index' }
#
#   # and provide these named routes
#   root_url   # => 'http://www.example.com/'
#   root_path  # => '/'
#
# Note: when using +controller+, the route is simply named after the
# method you call on the block parameter rather than map.
#
#   # In config/routes.rb
#   controller :blog do
#     get 'blog/show',    to: :list
#     get 'blog/delete',  to: :delete
#     get 'blog/edit',    to: :edit
#   end
#
#   # provides named routes for show, delete, and edit
#   link_to @article.title, blog_show_path(id: @article.id)
#
# == Pretty URLs
#
# Routes can generate pretty URLs. For example:
#
#   get '/articles/:year/:month/:day', to: 'articles#find_by_id', constraints: {
#     year:       /\d{4}/,
#     month:      /\d{1,2}/,
#     day:        /\d{1,2}/
#   }
#
# Using the route above, the URL "http://localhost:3000/articles/2005/11/06"
# maps to
#
#   params = {year: '2005', month: '11', day: '06'}
#
# == Regular Expressions and parameters
# You can specify a regular expression to define a format for a parameter.
#
#   controller 'geocode' do
#     get 'geocode/:postalcode', to: :show, constraints: {
#       postalcode: /\d{5}(-\d{4})?/
#     }
#   end
#
# Constraints can include the 'ignorecase' and 'extended syntax' regular
# expression modifiers:
#
#   controller 'geocode' do
#     get 'geocode/:postalcode', to: :show, constraints: {
#       postalcode: /hx\d\d\s\d[a-z]{2}/i
#     }
#   end
#
#   controller 'geocode' do
#     get 'geocode/:postalcode', to: :show, constraints: {
#       postalcode: /# Postalcode format
#          \d{5} #Prefix
#          (-\d{4})? #Suffix
#          /x
#     }
#   end
#
# Using the multiline modifier will raise an +ArgumentError+.
# Encoding regular expression modifiers are silently ignored. The
# match will always use the default encoding or ASCII.
#
# == External redirects
#
# You can redirect any path to another path using the redirect helper in your router:
#
#   get "/stories", to: redirect("/posts")
#
# == Unicode character routes
#
# You can specify unicode character routes in your router:
#
#   get "こんにちは", to: "welcome#index"
#
# == Routing to Rack Applications
#
# Instead of a String, like <tt>posts#index</tt>, which corresponds to the
# index action in the PostsController, you can specify any Rack application
# as the endpoint for a matcher:
#
#   get "/application.js", to: Sprockets
#
# == Reloading routes
#
# You can reload routes if you feel you must:
#
#   Rails.application.reload_routes!
#
# This will clear all named routes and reload config/routes.rb if the file has been modified from
# last load. To absolutely force reloading, use <tt>reload!</tt>.
#
# == Testing Routes
#
# The two main methods for testing your routes:
#
# === +assert_routing+
#
#   def test_movie_route_properly_splits
#     opts = {controller: "plugin", action: "checkout", id: "2"}
#     assert_routing "plugin/checkout/2", opts
#   end
#
# +assert_routing+ lets you test whether or not the route properly resolves into options.
#
# === +assert_recognizes+
#
#   def test_route_has_options
#     opts = {controller: "plugin", action: "show", id: "12"}
#     assert_recognizes opts, "/plugins/show/12"
#   end
#
# Note the subtle difference between the two: +assert_routing+ tests that
# a URL fits options while +assert_recognizes+ tests that a URL
# breaks into parameters properly.
#
# In tests you can simply pass the URL or named route to +get+ or +post+.
#
#   def send_to_jail
#     get '/jail'
#     assert_response :success
#   end
#
#   def goes_to_login
#     get login_url
#     #...
#   end
#
# == View a list of all your routes
#
#   rails routes
#
# Target a specific controller with <tt>-c</tt>, or grep routes
# using <tt>-g</tt>. Useful in conjunction with <tt>--expanded</tt>
# which displays routes vertically.

  # Includes devise_for method for routes. This method is responsible to
  # generate all needed routes for devise, based on what modules you have
  # defined in your model.
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  # Let's say you have an User model configured to use authenticatable,
  # confirmable and recoverable modules. After creating this inside your routes:
  #
  #   devise_for :users
  #
  # This method is going to look inside your User model and create the
  # needed routes:
  #
  #  # Session routes for Authenticatable (default)
  #       new_user_session GET    /users/sign_in                    {controller:"devise/sessions", action:"new"}
  #           user_session POST   /users/sign_in                    {controller:"devise/sessions", action:"create"}
  #   destroy_user_session DELETE /users/sign_out                   {controller:"devise/sessions", action:"destroy"}
  #
  #  # Password routes for Recoverable, if User model has :recoverable configured
  #      new_user_password GET    /users/password/new(.:format)     {controller:"devise/passwords", action:"new"}
  #     edit_user_password GET    /users/password/edit(.:format)    {controller:"devise/passwords", action:"edit"}
  #          user_password PUT    /users/password(.:format)         {controller:"devise/passwords", action:"update"}
  #                        POST   /users/password(.:format)         {controller:"devise/passwords", action:"create"}
  #
  #  # Confirmation routes for Confirmable, if User model has :confirmable configured
  #  new_user_confirmation GET    /users/confirmation/new(.:format) {controller:"devise/confirmations", action:"new"}
  #      user_confirmation GET    /users/confirmation(.:format)     {controller:"devise/confirmations", action:"show"}
  #                        POST   /users/confirmation(.:format)     {controller:"devise/confirmations", action:"create"}
  #
  # ==== Routes integration
  #
  # +devise_for+ is meant to play nicely with other routes methods. For example,
  # by calling +devise_for+ inside a namespace, it automatically nests your devise
  # controllers:
  #
  #     namespace :publisher do
  #       devise_for :account
  #     end
  #
  # The snippet above will use publisher/sessions controller instead of devise/sessions
  # controller. You can revert this change or configure it directly by passing the :module
  # option described below to +devise_for+.
  #
  # Also note that when you use a namespace it will affect all the helpers and methods
  # for controllers and views. For example, using the above setup you'll end with
  # following methods: current_publisher_account, authenticate_publisher_account!,
  # publisher_account_signed_in, etc.
  #
  # The only aspect not affect by the router configuration is the model name. The
  # model name can be explicitly set via the :class_name option.
  #
  # ==== Options
  #
  # You can configure your routes with some options:
  #
  #  * class_name: set up a different class to be looked up by devise, if it cannot be
  #    properly found by the route name.
  #
  #      devise_for :users, class_name: 'Account'
  #
  #  * path: allows you to set up path name that will be used, as rails routes does.
  #    The following route configuration would set up your route as /accounts instead of /users:
  #
  #      devise_for :users, path: 'accounts'
  #
  #  * singular: set up the singular name for the given resource. This is used as the helper methods
  #    names in controller ("authenticate_#{singular}!", "#{singular}_signed_in?", "current_#{singular}"
  #    and "#{singular}_session"), as the scope name in routes and as the scope given to warden.
  #
  #      devise_for :admins, singular: :manager
  #
  #      devise_scope :manager do
  #        ...
  #      end
  #
  #      class ManagerController < ApplicationController
  #        before_action authenticate_manager!
  #
  #        def show
  #          @manager = current_manager
  #          ...
  #        end
  #      end
  #
  #  * path_names: configure different path names to overwrite defaults :sign_in, :sign_out, :sign_up,
  #    :password, :confirmation, :unlock.
  #
  #      devise_for :users, path_names: {
  #        sign_in: 'login', sign_out: 'logout',
  #        password: 'secret', confirmation: 'verification',
  #        registration: 'register', edit: 'edit/profile'
  #      }
  #
  #  * controllers: the controller which should be used. All routes by default points to Devise controllers.
  #    However, if you want them to point to custom controller, you should do:
  #
  #      devise_for :users, controllers: { sessions: "users/sessions" }
  #
  #  * failure_app: a rack app which is invoked whenever there is a failure. Strings representing a given
  #    are also allowed as parameter.
  #
  #  * sign_out_via: the HTTP method(s) accepted for the :sign_out action (default: :delete),
  #    if you wish to restrict this to accept only :post or :delete requests you should do:
  #
  #      devise_for :users, sign_out_via: [:get, :post]
  #
  #    You need to make sure that your sign_out controls trigger a request with a matching HTTP method.
  #
  #  * module: the namespace to find controllers (default: "devise", thus
  #    accessing devise/sessions, devise/registrations, and so on). If you want
  #    to namespace all at once, use module:
  #
  #      devise_for :users, module: "users"
  #
  #  * skip: tell which controller you want to skip routes from being created.
  #    It accepts :all as an option, meaning it will not generate any route at all:
  #
  #      devise_for :users, skip: :sessions
  #
  #  * only: the opposite of :skip, tell which controllers only to generate routes to:
  #
  #      devise_for :users, only: :sessions
  #
  #  * skip_helpers: skip generating Devise url helpers like new_session_path(@user).
  #    This is useful to avoid conflicts with previous routes and is false by default.
  #    It accepts true as option, meaning it will skip all the helpers for the controllers
  #    given in :skip but it also accepts specific helpers to be skipped:
  #
  #      devise_for :users, skip: [:registrations, :confirmations], skip_helpers: true
  #      devise_for :users, skip_helpers: [:registrations, :confirmations]
  #
  #  * format: include "(.:format)" in the generated routes? true by default, set to false to disable:
  #
  #      devise_for :users, format: false
  #
  #  * constraints: works the same as Rails' constraints
  #
  #  * defaults: works the same as Rails' defaults
  #
  #  * router_name: allows application level router name to be overwritten for the current scope
  #
  # ==== Scoping
  #
  # Following Rails 3 routes DSL, you can nest devise_for calls inside a scope:
  #
  #   scope "/my" do
  #     devise_for :users
  #   end
  #
  # However, since Devise uses the request path to retrieve the current user,
  # this has one caveat: If you are using a dynamic segment, like so ...
  #
  #   scope ":locale" do
  #     devise_for :users
  #   end
  #
  # you are required to configure default_url_options in your
  # ApplicationController class, so Devise can pick it:
  #
  #   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  #     def self.default_url_options
  #       { locale: I18n.locale }
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # ==== Adding custom actions to override controllers
  #
  # You can pass a block to devise_for that will add any routes defined in the block to Devise's
  # list of known actions.  This is important if you add a custom action to a controller that
  # overrides an out of the box Devise controller.
  # For example:
  #
  #    class RegistrationsController < Devise::RegistrationsController
  #      def update
  #         # do something different here
  #      end
  #
  #      def deactivate
  #        # not a standard action
  #        # deactivate code here
  #      end
  #    end
  #
  # In order to get Devise to recognize the deactivate action, your devise_scope entry should look like this:
  #
  #     devise_scope :owner do
  #       post "deactivate", to: "registrations#deactivate", as: "deactivate_registration"
  #     end
  def devise_for(*resources); end

  # Sets the devise scope to be used in the controller. If you have custom routes,
  # you are required to call this method (also aliased as :as) in order to specify
  # to which controller it is targeted.
  #
  #   as :user do
  #     get "sign_in", to: "devise/sessions#new"
  #   end
  #
  # Notice you cannot have two scopes mapping to the same URL. And remember, if
  # you try to access a devise controller without specifying a scope, it will
  # raise ActionNotFound error.
  #
  # Also be aware of that 'devise_scope' and 'as' use the singular form of the
  # noun where other devise route commands expect the plural form. This would be a
  # good and working example.
  #
  #  devise_scope :user do
  #    get "/some/route" => "some_devise_controller"
  #  end
  #  devise_for :users
  #
  # Notice and be aware of the differences above between :user and :users
  def devise_scope(scope); end

  # Allow you to route based on whether a scope is *not* authenticated.
  # You can optionally specify which scope.
  #
  #   unauthenticated do
  #     as :user do
  #       root to: 'devise/registrations#new'
  #     end
  #   end
  #

# Authenticatable module. Holds common settings for authentication.
#
# == Options
#
# Authenticatable adds the following options to +devise+:
#
#   * +authentication_keys+: parameters used for authentication. By default [:email].
#
#   * +http_authentication_key+: map the username passed via HTTP Auth to this parameter. Defaults to
#     the first element in +authentication_keys+.
#
#   * +request_keys+: parameters from the request object used for authentication.
#     By specifying a symbol (which should be a request method), it will automatically be
#     passed to find_for_authentication method and considered in your model lookup.
#
#     For instance, if you set :request_keys to [:subdomain], :subdomain will be considered
#     as key on authentication. This can also be a hash where the value is a boolean specifying
#     if the value is required or not.
#
#   * +http_authenticatable+: if this model allows http authentication. By default false.
#     It also accepts an array specifying the strategies that should allow http.
#
#   * +params_authenticatable+: if this model allows authentication through request params. By default true.
#     It also accepts an array specifying the strategies that should allow params authentication.
#
#   * +skip_session_storage+: By default Devise will store the user in session.
#     By default is set to skip_session_storage: [:http_auth].
#
# == active_for_authentication?
#
# After authenticating a user and in each request, Devise checks if your model is active by
# calling model.active_for_authentication?. This method is overwritten by other devise modules. For instance,
# :confirmable overwrites .active_for_authentication? to only return true if your model was confirmed.
#
# You can overwrite this method yourself, but if you do, don't forget to call super:
#
#   def active_for_authentication?
#     super && special_condition_is_valid?
#   end
#
# Whenever active_for_authentication? returns false, Devise asks the reason why your model is inactive using
# the inactive_message method. You can overwrite it as well:
#
#   def inactive_message
#     special_condition_is_valid? ? super : :special_condition_is_not_valid

# Confirmable is responsible to verify if an account is already confirmed to
# sign in, and to send emails with confirmation instructions.
# Confirmation instructions are sent to the user email after creating a
# record and when manually requested by a new confirmation instruction request.
#
# Confirmable tracks the following columns:
#
# * confirmation_token   - A unique random token
# * confirmed_at         - A timestamp when the user clicked the confirmation link
# * confirmation_sent_at - A timestamp when the confirmation_token was generated (not sent)
# * unconfirmed_email    - An email address copied from the email attr. After confirmation
#                          this value is copied to the email attr then cleared
#
# == Options
#
# Confirmable adds the following options to +devise+:
#
#   * +allow_unconfirmed_access_for+: the time you want to allow the user to access their account
#     before confirming it. After this period, the user access is denied. You can
#     use this to let your user access some features of your application without
#     confirming the account, but blocking it after a certain period (ie 7 days).
#     By default allow_unconfirmed_access_for is zero, it means users always have to confirm to sign in.
#   * +reconfirmable+: requires any email changes to be confirmed (exactly the same way as
#     initial account confirmation) to be applied. Requires additional unconfirmed_email
#     db field to be set up (t.reconfirmable in migrations). Until confirmed, new email is
#     stored in unconfirmed email column, and copied to email column on successful
#     confirmation. Also, when used in conjunction with `send_email_changed_notification`,
#     the notification is sent to the original email when the change is requested,
#     not when the unconfirmed email is confirmed.
#   * +confirm_within+: the time before a sent confirmation token becomes invalid.

# The +ParameterSanitizer+ deals with permitting specific parameters values

#
# The sanitizer knows about Devise default parameters (like +password+ and
# +password_confirmation+ for the `RegistrationsController`), and you can
# extend or change the permitted parameters list on your controllers.
#
# === Permitting new parameters
#
# You can add new parameters to the permitted list using the +permit+ method
# in a +before_action+ method, for instance.
#
#    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
#      before_action :configure_permitted_parameters, if: :devise_controller?

#        # sign up parameters.
#        devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up, keys: [:subscribe_newsletter])
#      end
#    end
#
# Using a block yields an +ActionController::Parameters+ object so you can
# permit nested parameters and have more control over how the parameters are
# permitted in your controller.

  #
  # === Arguments
  #
  # * +action+ - A +Symbol+ with the action that the controller is
  #   performing, like +sign_up+, +sign_in+, etc.
  # * +keys:+     - An +Array+ of keys that also should be permitted.
  # * +except:+   - An +Array+ of keys that shouldn't be permitted.
  # * +block+     - A block that should be used to permit the action
  #   parameters instead of the +Array+ based approach. The block will be
  #   called with an +ActionController::Parameters+ instance.
  #
  # === Examples
  #
  #   # Adding new parameters to be permitted in the `sign_up` action.
  #   devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up, keys: [:subscribe_newsletter])
  #
  #   # Removing the `password` parameter from the `account_update` action.

# Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers is a helper module for facilitating
# authentication on Rails integration tests to bypass the required steps for
# signin in or signin out a record.
#
# Examples
#
#  class PostsTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
#    include Devise::Test::IntegrationHelpers
#
#    test 'authenticated users can see posts' do
#      sign_in users(:bob)

#      assert_response :success
#    end

# `Devise::Test::ControllerHelpers` provides a facility to test controllers
# in isolation when using `ActionController::TestCase` allowing you to
# quickly sign_in or sign_out a user. Do not use
# `Devise::Test::ControllerHelpers` in integration tests.
#
# Examples
#
#  class PostsTest < ActionController::TestCase

# behavior. Such callbacks should be tested in your integration suite instead.
